### **üìå Section 3: Working with Joins in SQL**  
Joins allow us to **combine data from multiple tables** based on a common column.  

---

## **üîπ Step 1: Create Two Tables**
We will create **Employees** and **Departments** tables.  

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT REFERENCES Departments(department_id),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```
üîπ **`Departments`** contains a list of departments.  
üîπ **`Employees`** contains employee details and references `department_id` from `Departments`.  

---

## **üîπ Step 2: Insert Data into Departments Table**
```sql
INSERT INTO Departments (department_name) VALUES
('HR'),
('IT'),
('Finance'),
('Sales'),
('Marketing');
```

‚úÖ **Now, `Departments` contains:**  
| department_id | department_name |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1            | HR             |
| 2            | IT             |
| 3            | Finance        |
| 4            | Sales          |
| 5            | Marketing      |

---

## **üîπ Step 3: Insert Data into Employees Table**
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (name, department_id, salary) VALUES
('Alice Johnson', 1, 55000),
('Bob Smith', 2, 75000),
('Charlie Davis', 3, 60000),
('David Brown', 4, 62000),
('Emily White', 2, 85000),
('Frank Black', 1, 58000),
('Grace Green', 2, 79000),
('Harry Adams', 3, 72000),
('Isla Blue', 5, 50000),
('Jack Carter', 5, 52000),
('Karen Miller', 4, 65000),
('Liam Scott', 2, 90000),
('Mia Roberts', 4, 58000),
('Noah Wilson', 2, 87000),
('Olivia Harris', 1, 56000),
('Peter Evans', 3, 67000),
('Quinn Lee', 2, 78000),
('Ryan Walker', 4, 70000),
('Sophia Allen', 5, 54000),
('Tom Baker', 2, 81000);
```

‚úÖ **Now, `Employees` contains:**  
| employee_id | name         | department_id | salary |
|------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 1          | Alice Johnson | 1           | 55000  |
| 2          | Bob Smith     | 2           | 75000  |
| 3          | Charlie Davis | 3           | 60000  |
| ...        | ...           | ...         | ...    |

## **üîπ Step 4: Perform Different Types of Joins**

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN (Matching Data in Both Tables)**
The `INNER JOIN` returns **only the records that have matching values** in both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
‚úÖ **This returns only employees who have a valid department.**  
üí° **Employees assigned to non-existing departments will NOT be shown.**

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN (All Employees, Even Without Departments)**
The `LEFT JOIN` returns **all records from the left table (`Employees`)** and **matching records from the right table (`Departments`)**.

```sql
SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
‚úÖ **Shows all employees, even if they don‚Äôt belong to a department.**  
üí° **If there‚Äôs no department, `NULL` is shown for `department_name`.**

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ RIGHT JOIN (All Departments, Even Without Employees)**
The `RIGHT JOIN` returns **all records from the right table (`Departments`)** and **matching records from the left table (`Employees`)**.

```sql
SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
‚úÖ **Shows all departments, even if no employees belong to them.**  
üí° **If there‚Äôs no employee in a department, `NULL` appears for `name` and `salary`.**

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ FULL JOIN (All Data from Both Tables)**
The `FULL JOIN` returns **all records from both tables**.  
If there is **no match**, `NULL` is returned for missing values.

```sql
SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
FULL JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
‚úÖ **Shows all employees and all departments, even if some don‚Äôt match.**

---

## **üîπ Example Results**
| name           | salary  | department_name |
|---------------|--------|----------------|
| Alice Johnson | 55000  | HR             |
| Bob Smith     | 75000  | IT             |
| Charlie Davis | 60000  | Finance        |
| David Brown   | 62000  | Sales          |
| NULL          | NULL   | Marketing      | (RIGHT JOIN case) |
| NULL          | NULL   | IT Support     | (FULL JOIN case) |

---

### **üìù Key Takeaways**
- **`INNER JOIN`** ‚Üí Only matching records from both tables.  
- **`LEFT JOIN`** ‚Üí All employees, even if they don‚Äôt have a department.  
- **`RIGHT JOIN`** ‚Üí All departments, even if they don‚Äôt have employees.  
- **`FULL JOIN`** ‚Üí All data from both tables, filling missing values with `NULL`.
